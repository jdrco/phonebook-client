# phonebook-client
This repo contains the frontend code for a full stack phonebook application. This was bootstrapped with 'create react app' and is built into static files by the phonebook-server repo when deploying to Heroku.

The single-page app is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed here: https://obscure-shelf-60375.herokuapp.com/

The backend code is found in this repo: https://github.com/jdrco/phonebook-server
